ConstraintLayout : demo, animation demo

## RecyclerView Parallex Effect
It's a magic of GuideLine. 

P.S. [Second Appraoch] 
It could also be done by a ImageView whose scaleType is matrix. 
As you scorll the RecyclerView, the matrix of that ImageView will move as well.


## Expand/Collapsed
Just use `ConstraintSet` to load two different layout xml, and apply one of them to the ContraintLayout in your Activity.
